Daily Water Demand Estimator

To estimate future water demand, we use historical data of population count, water consumption, weather data, and holidays. 
The first step is the thorough analysis of historical data. Early in the process it showed that the per capita demand can be
related to various factors. It is also a better parameter to work with as it is independent of the population count.
A comparative analysis with temporal information showed differences in demand depending on the day of the week, time of the year, 
and, if the day is holiday. The correlation analysis to weather data showed a substantial correlation to the average temperature 
and weak to no correlation to other weather variables. Hence, a temperature correction is applied while other variables are neglected.
From here, we can organize the days in a year in different categories that are stored in a look-up table.

The tool is designed to estimate per capita demand for a specific day. For an estimate, the tool is first provided with basic information: 
a "holiday calendar", and a temperature time-series for the region where demand is estimated.
Then we provide a date for which demand should be estimated and the tool checks for day of the week, time of the year, holiday or not, 
applies a temperature correction (if provided) and returns an estimate for the per capita demand. 
To obtain the total demand, the result is multiplied with the population count. 

The tool is also equipped to estimate WD for different scenarios (mean, max, mixed) to estimate the average or maximum demand for a day.
To produce longer time-series, a "mixed" scenario is included that introduces variability within reasonable boundaries. If monthly values 
are required, the computations are still performed on a daily basis but aggregated in monthly sums.

Limitations:
The tool requires a set of input data (daily values for daily demand estimate) of water demand, and weather data. Furthermore, population
counts are needed to compute the per-capita which is usually available in monthly or annual resolution. A linear interpolation is usually 
appropriate as population numbers usually don't experience drastic changes throughout the year. The obtained per capita demand is still
reasonably accurate. 

The tool is technically only valid for municipalities that are present in the input data. However, similarities in per capita demand do 
usually not differ substantially if no major industry is present that receives water from the water supplier. 
Hence, estimates for third municipalities can be made, but the uncertainty is higher, especially if spatial distances are large (weather).

"asg_wpc.csv" contains daily per capita demand for the regions am (Ammerbuch), tu (Tübingen), and rb (Rottenburg)
values are computed by dividing the provided amount of water for each date with the linearly interpolated (original: annual values) population number for this region 
column "mean" is computed with weighted averages for each region
To correct for missing municipalities (e.g. Böblingen) the per capita demand was computed from monthly data (all municipalities available) 
and a bias correction is made (~ +13%).

How to: 
Script 
"demand_estimator.py" estimates daily per capita demand for ASG municipalities with temperature correction in different variants
after Line 430: start, end: Datestring of start and end date [dd.mm.yyyy]
temperature must be provided for every day

Line 258ff:
load spatial data (model outline)
load temperature data
temperature is mapped on 500x500m grid and averages are calculated for every day 
	--> "getT4date" computes spatial average temp for given date

Line 292ff:
Municipalities are defined
load population data
make manual corrections
load population predictions (relative growth of population starting from population in december 2020)
per capita demand data is loaded (computed in a different script)
load holiday data [name, start_date, end_date]
time series of per capita demand is manually subdivided into periods with different characteristics (iterative process)

Line 368ff:
compute temperature correction, linear function, least square fit

Line 379ff:
"wpc_dic" is defined: dictionary containing per capita demand values for all previously defined periods

Line 439ff:
Example calculation: 
provide start and end date
turn into "date_range"
create empty dataframe with column "demand" filled with zeros
define scenario
loop through dates
	get temperature for date
	call "getDemand4date" and save result in dataframe
dataframe is saved as .csv file


Function "getDemand4date": computes per capita demand for date provided
requires the "wpc_dic", date, holiday data, scenario [mid,max,mixed], Temperature is optional
checks for day of week, day of year, and if the date is in a holiday period or not
based on the scenario different parts of the "wpc_dic" are checked for per capita demand
Scenario "mixed": random number "a" is drawn between 0 and 1 -> weight between mean and max demand
temperature correction applied in the end

###================================================================================================================###

"demand2well.py" can estimate daily demand, but should rather be provided with estimated demand from "Demand Estimator.py"
file contains time series with daily values of per capita water demand in [m^3/d]
after Line 304: start, end: Datestring of start and end date [dd.mm.yyyy]
provide path and name to demand file in variable "file"
define restrictions as dictionary: {wellname:{"rate":X, "start": date, "end": date, "year": year}}
function "getWellRates computes total demand and well rates, requires: population variant, scenario, startdate, enddate, restrictions, BWV rate, file, initial population

Demand2Well

To obtain the well extraction rates for a certain demand, the required volume of water is distributed between the available wells, according
to the respective legal limits (Wasserrecht). We compute the fraction that each well contributes to the total extraction by dividing the 
individual extraction limit with the sum of all extraction limits. 

To account for irregularities in the well operation, an option to limit the well extraction is included. The limit can be any number larger than zero.
To apply a restriction to a well, start- and end-date of the restriction, as well as the maximum possible rate during this time are passed to 
the distribution tool. After the initial rates are computed, it is checked if any legal restricitions are exceeded, if so the rates are redistributed 
if possible, until all limits are obeyed. The tool seeks to distribute the entire extraction without using any of the limited number of peak demand days. 
If this is not possible, the tool keeps track of how many days have been used within a year. 

Limitations:
While in reality well extractions are controlled by a black-box model that consideres water levels in wells and energy costs on top of the legal limits.
The present tool is not capable of reproducing the two additional factors.


Line 315ff:
define population scenario "PopVar" 
define start & end of estimation period
define unit ["m3/d" recommended]
define fixed bwv rate, if None it will be set to the defaukt value of 103 l/s
define restrictions: Dictionary {Name_well: {"rate": [m^3/d], "start": [dd.mm.yyyy], "end": [dd.mm.yyyy]}}
	for as many wells as desired. At some point the optimization wont be able to redistribute the water demand as legal limits are exceeded.

Line 332ff:
load original well data for comparison and datastructure for output files.

Line 343ff: 
Example calculation with pre-defined demand from "demand_estimator.py". file = "./WaterDemand/syntheticDemand_14_21.csv"
"scenario" variable has no function if demand file is provided!!!
No restrictions (restrictions = {})
load original population data (ew = pd.read_csv("./Population/EinwohnerASG_corrected.csv", index_col = "Jahr"))
	and process to fit required format
call main function:
	demand, demand_after_bwv, wells, bwv_ts, wr_ts = getWellRates(PopVar, scenario, start, end, restrictions, bwv, unit = unit, file = file, pop = pop)
	original well file is updated with new columns

Line 375ff:
Example calculation without provided demand --> demand is estimated

Input:  PopVar: Population variant (for future estimates, use initial population from 12/2021)
	scenario: Population growth scenario [V1-V5], loads scneario from saved dictionary (function "get_demand"), no effect if population number or timeseries is provided
	start, end: date
	restrictions: [dict]
	bwv: rate (if None --> bwv = 103 [l/s]
	unit: [m^3/d] no effect yet, will likely be removed
	file: path to water demand file containing per capita demand [m^3/(d*person)]
	pop: population count, integer or timeseries (pandas df)
	
Output: demand : total water demand
	demand_after_bwv: water demand that has to be satisfied from wells (BWV substracted)

Checks if "file" is None, if so demand is estimated with function "get_demand"
if "file" is provided, per capita demand is multiplied with population count and multiplied with 1.091 (compensation for water use in production)
Checks if "bwv" is defined, if not it is set to default (103 l/s), converted in timeseries
Checks for restrictions in BWV and alters timeseries accordingly
Computes demand that must be satisfied from wells (total demand - bwv delivery)
calls function "demand2well"
	
Function: "demand2well":
Input:  demand: water demand after BWV delivery [m^3/d]
	restrictions: dict, as defined above

Output: rates: pumping rates for ASG wells
	wr_ts: see above

loads file containing legal limits (Wasserrechte) + processing, conversion to timeseries
computing fractions from water rights: frac = wr/wr.sum() -> fraction of demand that is produced by well X
checks restrictions: if restrictions are present they are included in wr_ts as upper limits
computing fractions again with restrictions
pumping rates are computed by multiplying fractions (no restrictions) with total water demand
calls function "check_rates"

Function: "check_rates":
Input:  demand: should be clear by now :)
	rates: well rates (see above)
	wr: actually not required
	wr_ts: see above
	restrictions: see above
	verbose: bool, let's function talk
	couple_compensation: bool, default: False, 
	
Output: rates: optimized well rates
	wr_ts: as above, after optimization, if peak demand days are used, it is indicated here
	
Function checks if any of the well rates exceed the legal limits (wr_ts)
	if verbose: print output if limits are exceeded
loops through all years in provided input files
	checks restrictions, if any restrictions apply a flag is set
	checks if couple compensation is applied: checks restriction for well couples (Entringen/Poltringen), if one of them is restricted, 
		the other well within the couple will compensate 50 % (can be changed) of the restricted wells deficit (common extractions limits - gemeinsames Wasserrecht)
	if legal limits are exceeded, loop through all days and wells
	if a flag is found: check if peak demand days are available -> if yes: peak extraction set in wr_ts
recompute extraction fractions with updated wr_ts
recompute well rates
check for deficits again, print results and return optimized well rates
	

Function: "get_demand":
Input:  PopVar: see above
	scenario: see above
	start, end: date
	daily: bool, default is True, if False, monthly aggregation is applied but still returns m^3/day
Output: demand: water demand (daily or monthly, but always [m^3/d] (Modflow requiremen))

Function roughly estimates water demand. Computations performed on monthly basis, also for daily output -> one month will have similar demand every day
