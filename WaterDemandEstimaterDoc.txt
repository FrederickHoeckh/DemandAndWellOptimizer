Daily Water Demand Estimator

To estimate future water demand, we use historical data of population count, water consumption, weather data, and holidays. 
The first step is the thorough analysis of historical data. Early in the process it showed that the per capita demand can be
related to various factors. It is also a better parameter to work with as it is independent of the population count.
A comparative analysis with temporal information showed differences in demand depending on the day of the week, time of the year, 
and, if the day is holiday. The correlation analysis to weather data showed a substantial correlation to the average temperature 
and weak to no correlation to other weather variables. Hence, a temperature correction is applied while other variables are neglected.
From here, we can organize the days in a year in different categories that are stored in a look-up table.

The tool is designed to estimate per capita demand for a specific day. For an estimate, the tool is first provided with basic information: 
a "holiday calendar", and a temperature time-series for the region where demand is estimated.
Then we provide a date for which demand should be estimated and the tool checks for day of the week, time of the year, holiday or not, 
applies a temperature correction (if provided) and returns an estimate for the per capita demand. 
To obtain the total demand, the result is multiplied with the population count. 

The tool is also equipped to estimate WD for different scenarios (mean, max, mixed) to estimate the average or maximum demand for a day.
To produce longer time-series, a "mixed" scenario is included that introduces variability within reasonable boundaries. If monthly values 
are required, the computations are still performed on a daily basis but aggregated in monthly sums.

Limitations:
The tool requires a set of input data (daily values for daily demand estimate) of water demand, and weather data. Furthermore, population
counts are needed to compute the per-capita which is usually available in monthly or annual resolution. A linear interpolation is usually 
appropriate as population numbers usually don't experience drastic changes throughout the year. The obtained per capita demand is still
reasonably accurate. 

The tool is technically only valid for municipalities that are present in the input data. However, similarities in per capita demand do 
usually not differ substantially if no major industry is present that receives water from the water supplier. 
Hence, estimates for third municipalities can be made, but the uncertainty is higher, especially if spatial distances are large (weather).

How to: 
Script "Demand Estimator.py" estimates daily per capita demand with temperature correction in different variants
	after Line 430: start, end: Datestring of start and end date [dd.mm.yyyy]
	temperature must be provided for every day

       "estimateDemand_daily.py" can estimate daily demand, but should rather be provided with estimated demand from "Demand Estimator.py"
	file contains time series with daily values of per capita water demand in [m^3/d]
	after Line 304: start, end: Datestring of start and end date [dd.mm.yyyy]
	provide path and name to demand file in variable "file"
	define restrictions as dictionary: {wellname:{"rate":X, "start": date, "end": date, "year": year}}
	function "getWellRates computes total demand and well rates, requires: population variant, scenario, startdate, enddate, restrictions, BWV rate, file, initial population
     
       "estimateDemand_monthly.py" estimates monthly water demand, doesn't require a prepared water demand time series, uses historic averages
	everything else is more or less equal to the daily version (above)


Demand2Well

To obtain the well extraction rates for a certain demand, the required volume of water is distributed between the available wells, according
to the respective legal limits (Wasserrecht). We compute the fraction that each well contributes to the total extraction by dividing the 
individual extraction limit with the sum of all extraction limits. 

To account for irregularities in the well operation, an option to limit the well extraction is included. The limit can be any number larger than zero.
To apply a restriction to a well, start- and end-date of the restriction, as well as the maximum possible rate during this time are passed to 
the distribution tool. After the initial rates are computed, it is checked if any legal restricitions are exceeded, if so the rates are redistributed 
if possible, until all limits are obeyed. The tool seeks to distribute the entire extraction without using any of the limited number of peak demand days. 
If this is not possible, the tool keeps track of how many days have been used within a year. 

Limitations:
While in reality well extractions are controlled by a black-box model that consideres water levels in wells and energy costs on top of the legal limits.
The present tool is not capable of reproducing the two additional factors.
